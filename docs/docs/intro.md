# Introduction

The purpose of Adastry's documentation is to give more in depth understanding of the provided services.

Common questions should be answered along the way. If something is missing or need further explanation,
please start a discussion on our
[Github Q&A page](https://github.com/PaskLab/adastry-ui/discussions/categories/q-a).

## What is Adastry

Adastry started as a rewards tracking service.
The goal was to track user [stake account](/learn/docs/definitions#account) rewards history in a simple way.

Depending on the jurisdiction, rewards count as income at the moment they are received, and most wallet
software will show the rewards account balance without the payment history. This is where Adastry comes
into play by fetching and processing these data, with some sugar on top of it..! üç∞

The service is set to grow with its user needs, so it is not limited to rewards tracking. Adastry already
pack other useful features, and we count on our users to share their needs with us.

## What Adastry is not

- __**__ A tax reporting tool. (ie: [Koinly](https://koinly.io/), [CoinTracker](https://www.cointracker.io/),
[accointing](https://www.accointing.com/))
- A blockchain explorer.
- A wallet client software.

__**__ While the main use case for using Adastry is tax reporting need, we only facilitate the acquisition and
processing of your data. We do not provide profit/loss calculation. Each country have their own tax requirements,
make sure to check with your local professional.

## Current limitation

Since the service was meant for staked accounts, addresses linked to unregistered stake credential cannot
be monitored at the moment.

Without registering the stake credential on the blockchain, there is nothing to allow us to deduce the relation
between addresses under a same account.
