# Introduction to CSV

A Comma Separated Values (**CSV**) file is a plain text file that stores data by delimiting data 
entries with commas. This file format can be imported in different spreadsheet software such as Excel,
or in cryptocurrency Tax application like [Koinly.io](https://koinly.io/).

## Supported Tax Software

:::info

If there is a cryptocurrency tax software for which you would like us to add support, please make a 
**[feature request](https://github.com/PaskLab/adastry-ui/discussions/categories/feature-request)**.

:::

We currently support the following tax software:

- [Koinly.io](https://koinly.io/)

## Export Options

There are two main options to choose from, and some sub-options to filter and format the data to fit your needs.

### "Account" VS "Bulk" export

You can export each account individually by accessing the **"Export Data"** tab under
**"Dashboard > View Account > Export Data Tab"**.

But if you would like to consider many accounts as a single account for the sake of simplicity,
you can choose the **Bulk Export** option available directly on the dashboard.

:::tip

Note that the **Bulk Export button** will be
displayed only if you have linked more than 1 account.
