# Subscription Plans

In order to insure Adastry sustainability, some features like `CSV Export` are only available as **Premium Features**.

The free **Basic Plan** will allow you to try the application and see if it could be a right fit for your needs.

**Plans** apply to wallet account, not user account. Some user linked wallet accounts can be included in certain
premium plan, while other are left out.

**Paid Plans** gives access to all features and will last a year.
Once expired, it is up to the user to renew his subscriptions.

See [Adastry's plans & pricing here](https://adastry.io/pricing).

Any user creating an account on Adastry is included in the **Basic Plan**.
