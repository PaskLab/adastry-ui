# Verified Accounts

:::tip

Even if you're a fast typer and do prefer password authentication, we still strongly suggest verifying 
one or more accounts. This will give you a way to access your account if you lose your username or password.

:::

### What are verified accounts ?
**Verified accounts** are accounts where you have proven ownership through a message signature verification process.

### How to sign in with wallet authentication ?

Adastry wallet authentication requires users to first link a verified account to their user account.

This can be done either by creating a new user account using the *ownership proof option*, or in an existing 
user account using the "Verified Accounts" feature available in **Settings > Security**.

### Security and wallet authentication

Wallet authentication is considered more secure than using a password. Your password, weaker than your 
wallet signature encryption, never leaves your computer.

Message signing is safe. It is not a transaction, therefore has no cost. You encrypt, never decrypt.
