# Statistics

Statistics is a good way to follow and compare how your different accounts are doing.
A few basic statistics are currently offered on Adastry, but there still a lot of work to
be done on this side.

## Dashboard Statistics

### Monthly Rewards

This graph represent the average monthly rewards amount received for all yours accounts.

### Average Stake

This graph represent the combined average monthly active stake of yours accounts.

## Stake Pools

:::caution
These statistics are currently flawed and not meaningful. This section needs to be reworked to provide
better statistics and information on chosen pools.
:::

### Past year Pools Stats

#### ROS - Return on Stake

This is the average yearly performance of your accounts for a given pool. For accounts delegated for less than a year,
the performance is extrapolated for a year.

#### ROO (SPO accounts only) - Return on Operation

This is the average yearly performance for a pool operation.
